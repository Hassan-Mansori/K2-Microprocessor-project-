 Collaborated with a peer to design and implement an 8-bit microprocessor featuring a datapath, multiplexers, counters, and shift registers.
 The design was described using SystemVerilog, synthesized with Vivado, and successfully deployed on an FPGA. 
 Additionally, developed a software tool in C to convert assembly instructions into machine code and simulate microprocessor operations.
